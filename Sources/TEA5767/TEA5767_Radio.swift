/// Communicate with a TEA5767 FM tuner over I2C.
///
/// The TEA5767 is an FM receiver previously manufactured by Philips/NXP but now discontinued. Boards
/// with clones of the chip seem readily available, though some functions may be missing or not fully
/// implemented by these chios.
///
/// The 2007 Revision 5 of the NXP datasheet may be found [here.](https://www.voti.nl/docs/TEA5767.pdf)
///
/// - Note: The TEA5767 has an interesting and somewhat uncommon access pattern. Any write is
/// interpreted as configuring settings; any read is interpreted as asking for configuration. In both cases,
/// no registers are named: instead, [up to] 5 bytes are transferred. Their semantics depend only on their
/// position in the sequence. See `TEA5767_ReadLayout` and `TEA5767_WriteLayout`.
/// - Note: Preset tuning is not implemented; feature seems sparsely documented.
