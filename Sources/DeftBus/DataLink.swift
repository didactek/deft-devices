/// Interface to support talking to a connected I^2C device using simple, unidirectional, non-composed reads or writes.

/// I^2C devices typically reset their parsing state at the beginning of a conversation; state is discarded
/// when the STOP signal indicates the end of the exchange.
/// Notably, reads are strictly a pull from the device with no mechanism for the clocking node to issue a request first.
///
/// Simple conversations are usually highly typical, with only one format for read actions and one format for writes.
///
/// All reads/writes finish by terminating the message with a STOP.
