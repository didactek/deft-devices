///
/// Each operation here finishes by terminating the conversation with a STOP.

    /// In its ready state, the I2C clock is held low by the coordinator. When the coordinator is ready to send
    /// data, it releases the clock line, which would normally get pulled high by the bias resistors on the bus.
    /// If a device is not ready to process input, it may hold the clock line low until it is ready, preventing the
    /// clock signal from appearing on the bus and signalling to the coordinator that data is not being transferred.
    ///
    /// If a driver that does not support clock stretching is talking with a device that uses it for flow control,
    /// a few techniques might reduce the application of clock stretching to the point the device is usable:
    /// - reduce bus speed
    /// - add delays after operations (like configuration, reset) that will take time for the device to complete
